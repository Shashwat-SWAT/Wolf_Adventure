# Wolf_Adventure
I am planning on making a game in godot but before that i want to write a skeleton code in python. let's see how it goes

So the games runs like:

winning and losing conditions are based on
player - hp
wolf - hp

if player reaches hp '0' first then the game is over else the player wins the game.
